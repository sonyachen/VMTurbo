VMTurbo Front-end Practice Test
Coded by Sonya Chen

I decided to code the image completely from scratch without using any frameworks to showcase that I understand the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I do know how to implement Bootstrap.

At the moment there is no javascript as I have yet to design a reasonable functionality with it. Adding animations is great, but when there's no fundamental purpose to it, it tends to detract from the design.

You'll note in the CSS, I've added a table of contents to find the style of each section easier. You'll probably also note that I use individual property of padding and margin a lot, this is just my preference, I am flexible and can switch to single line calls if needed for consistancy with exisiting code.

I worked in Visual Studio Code and used github repository to upload the entire code. This is hosted in Microsoft's Azure which is free.

There may be compatibility issues espeically for mobile, but I worked in 1920 x 1080 with a 15" laptop screen on Chrome. I've checked the site in IE and Firefox, both of which looked as designed.
